# Bulk Overlay

Bulk Overlay is a simple tool to overlay an image on top of another image.

It is designed to be used with a large number of images and a single overlay image. The tool will overlay the overlay image on top of each image in the input directory and save the result in the output directory.

## TODO
1. Use CSD
2. Add a way to offset base image, image filters/effects
3. Add option to save as JPEG and adjust quality
4. Save state
